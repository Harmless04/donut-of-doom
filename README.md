# **black**_**hole**

Black hole simulation project

Here is the black hole raw code, everything will be inside a src bin incase you want to copy the files

I'm writing this as I'm beginning this project (hopefully I complete it ;D) here is what I plan to do:

1. Ray-tracing : add ray tracing to the gravity simulation to simulate gravitational lensing

2. Accretion disk : simulate accreciate disk using the ray tracing + the halos

3. Spacetime curvature : demonstrate visually the "trapdoor in spacetime" that is black holes using spacetime grid

4. [optional] try to make it run realtime ;D

I hope it works :/
